## Plot summary

Months before the start of the game, Nathan Woodcock has become known as 'The Toughest of 'em All'. Using this title
he has managed to create peace amongst the schools and stop bullying from taking place; however, that all changes when his
friend, Buddy, arrives beaten with news that the schools are now rising up to find a new hardknock.

Pissed, Woodcock leaves his girlfriend with Buddy and scives off school to prove once more that he is: The Toughest of 'em All.

Heading to the closest school, where Buddy was attacked, Woodcock arrives at Chase Academy, a former comprehensive just like his own school.

Fighting through the corridors, canteens and playgrounds, Woodcock finally arrives at Lees Hall. There, he faces off against his old nemesis
Hardman Carlin (scum reference). After defeating him, he discovers that the Catholic school has declared a new crusade to prove their hardness,
drawing Woodcock's attention.

Woodcock receives a frosty reception, arriving at the school shortly before the students are ready to set out to fight and prove themselves.
First, fighting through the courtyard, Woodcock learns from a choir-maiden that the ringleader is a priest-in-training hold-up in the chapel.

Woodcock pushes through the classrooms until finally he reaches the chapel, only to find it is locked. The choir-maiden unlocks it for him
and prays that he can 'restore the peace of christ over the land'.

Woodcock defeats the last of the followers and faces the priest. After breaking him through an altar, Woodcock begins to leave when he is
stopped by the choir-maiden. She informs him that the priest was incited to fight by a noblelad known as Monty.

Woodcock arrives at Etun Private school for Boys and fights through the dorms, courtyard and classrooms looking for Monty until finally
at the top of a winding staircase in the library, he finds him. Monty reveals that he was indeed the instigator, he knew it would draw Woodcock
out. If he can defeat Woodcock, a new era of fighting amongst the commoners which will keep them down and poor will begin.

Woodcock fights Monty, eventually kicking his ass through a window and out into the courtyard, ending his plot.
The choir-maiden arrives just in-time to patch Woodcock's wound as they look out at the defeated Monty, a new era of peace now upon them.

## Game Loop

Each level consists of several screens that the player must traverse from left to right.

Obstacles will include platforms, pit-traps and enemies that the player must overcome to proceed.

The player can jump, fight with punches, and use power-ups to change their special move.

At the end of the screens, the player must fight and defeat a boss to proceed to the next level.

Both before and after a level there will be static screen cutscenes with text to help put across the plot.
